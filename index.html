               <BR>

                    <LI><STRONG>Ability to take a risk:</STRONG> Starting any new venture involves a considerable amount of failure risk. Therefore, an entrepreneur needs to be courageous and able to evaluate and take risks, which is an essential part of being an entrepreneur.</LI>
